# ECUtbildning_SQL

This repository contains SQL scripts and Jupyter Notebook files created as part of a knowledge assessment in SQL programming. The scripts and notebooks are designed to interact with the AdventureWorks2022 database, performing various data analysis tasks, including sales summaries, customer distributions, and statistical analyses.

Contents
### SQL Scripts:

Comprehensive SQL queries that perform tasks such as calculating total sales, average order values, customer distributions, and more.

Advanced queries involving statistical analysis, including confidence intervals and median calculations.

### Jupyter Notebooks:

  Python scripts using SQLAlchemy and pyodbc to connect to the SQL Server and execute SQL queries.
  
  Data visualization using Matplotlib to plot sales data, customer distributions, and other key metrics.

### Key Features
  Data Analysis: Detailed analysis of sales data, including total sales, average order values, and customer distributions.
  
  Statistical Analysis: Calculation of confidence intervals, medians, and other statistical metrics to understand sales trends.
  
  Data Visualization: Visual representations of sales data, customer distributions, and other key metrics using Matplotlib.
